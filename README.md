# express-elm

This is an attempt to make a simple website using ExpressJS, Elm, and Sqlite3. The front end should be able to request stuff from the database and then display it to the user.

## how to install (I think)

git clone the repository
and then "npm install"
then "npm run dev"
and go to localhost:8000

__Make sure dev dependencies are installed, namely elm-live, nodemon, and npm-run-all__
